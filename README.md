## <p align="center">What am I Building?</p>

Subvid stream is a dapp made on **Celo Blockchain**. It allows users to post links to their premium content that they want to show as in exchange of timely payments using a **Subscription Plan System**.

For the _Payment system_ Subvid uses **ERC20 tokens** on **Celo Blockchain**. The token used for the transactions is **cUSD (Celo Dollar)**.

- Users can come on platform to view or upload content
- Viewers need to select a subscription plan and pay that to the owner of the content
- Subscriptions will end on different durations based on the plan chosen
- Users can check how much cUSD they earned via subscriptions from the platform
